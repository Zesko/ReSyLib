The library is testet on a beaglebone black. \r\n\r\n### Goal of the Library\r\nThe goal of the BBBlib is to provide easy GPIO-access for the beaglebone black. Additionally samples of C++11 code are provided which are commonly used in reactive systems: hardware abstraction layer, proxy, finite state machine, active object, and others\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nThis project is part of a lecture class by Prof Stephan Pareigis at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, Department Computer Science.
